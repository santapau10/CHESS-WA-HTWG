        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The objective of the chessBoard game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means the king is in a position to be
            captured and cannot escape capture.</p>

        <h3>ChessBoard</h3>
        <p>The chessboard consists of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The squares are alternately colored dark and
            light. The ranks are numbered from 1 to 8, and the files are lettered from a to h.</p>

        <h3>Chess Pieces</h3>
        <p>There are six different types of chessBoard pieces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>King</li>
            <li>Queen</li>
            <li>Rook</li>
            <li>Knight</li>
            <li>Bishop</li>
            <li>Pawn</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each piece has specific movement capabilities and restrictions.</p>

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>Players take turns to move their pieces. A move consists of moving one of the player's pieces to another square
            according to the rules of that particular piece. There are different types of moves, such as regular moves,
            capturing opponent's pieces, and special moves like castling and en passant capture.</p>

        <h3>Special Rules</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Castling</strong>: A special move where the king and a rook are simultaneously moved. It is only
                allowed under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>En passant</strong>: A special rule that allows a pawn to capture an opponent's pawn that has moved
                two squares forward from its starting position, as if it had only moved one square.</li>
            <li><strong>Pawn Promotion</strong>: When a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank, it can be promoted to any
                other piece except the king.</li>
        </ul>
